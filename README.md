# Intro
- This is a React application where the user can create records using a form and afterwards
see them displayed in a table. The form validates the input data and displays any error messages.
- The table contains a search field which can be used to filter the table items by User Name.
  - If no search param is provided, all the current records are shown.
  - If the search param is invalid, the table state will not change.
  - If the search param is valid, the results will be displayed in the table.
